Dividend is a new digital currency with the goal of empowering the community. While cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are by design philosophically neutral, most choose to implement a system of capitalism. Dividend is inspired by ideas of socialism, exploring the ways in which people can own a share of a piece of art. To be a part of this community, you can opt in, and get your share.
