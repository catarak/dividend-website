				Dividend is a new digital currency which is mutally owned and exchanged online.
			</h2>
			<p class="app__about-copy-section">
				Dividend coins operate the same way as physical coinsâ€”except that they only exist virtually. While currencies such as pound notes are regulated by official channels like the Bank of England, the control of digital currencies is shared by many users.
			</p>
			<p class="app__about-copy-section">
				Cryptocurrencies are decentralised, and driven by a global network of servers. Each server runs a computer programme which verifies the authenticity of each individual unit of currency, making transactions secure. Each server also holds a public record which files and validates every transaction of the virtual currency. The public record, as well as the network of servers, starts small but grows bigger as communities begin to use them.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you receive your share of Dividend coins, you opt in to a larger community. You are free to influence that community, by purchasing more coins, accepting coins in exchange for goods or services, or simply holding onto them.

					You need a wallet to hold your Dividend coins, just like you use a wallet in real life to hold your physical money.

				<p class="purchase__column-copy">
					We used a third-party service called Counterparty to create our currency, which has a few services for holding Dividend coins.
				</p>
				<p class="purchase__column-copy">
					You can download IndieSquare, a mobile wallet for iOS and Android, in the <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/kauntao-cai-bu/id977972108">App Store</a> or from <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=inc.lireneosoft.counterparty">Google Play</a>.
